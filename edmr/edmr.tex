With EDMR we observe the hopping charge as it travels to the charge bearing group through the electrode.

\section{Distribution of Current Density in On-Substrate Meander-Shaped Electrodes}
Meander-shaped electrodes shown in Figure~\ref{fig:grid} are used to study properties of thin conductive films. The distribution of electric potential and the current within a film of poor conductivity and a finite thickness be not obvious.

A numerical solution was found to the distribution of the current density $\vec{j}$ within a film of a finite thickness, connected by two metal electrodes. Two cases were considered, a thick film and a thin film.
