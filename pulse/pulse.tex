\section{Three-Dimensional Electron Gas with Inter-Spin Interactions}
The observations of pulsed EPR spectra in densely packed nitroxide radicals have risen questions regarding the physical model that would be able to describe these systems. So far no model for such system could explain the results of the distorted EPR spectra and an attempt was made to introduce the inter-spin interactions in the three-dimensional electron gas that appears to be the most accurate model of a polymer cathode film.
